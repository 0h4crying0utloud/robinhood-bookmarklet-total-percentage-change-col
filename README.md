# robinhood-bookmarklet-total-percentage-change-col (It's a hack job)
Calculates total percentage return, adds corresponding column to the stocks table, and sorts by it. 
It's not perfect as it has to manipulate Robinhood's rendered react results but it does the job. 

# To use
This is a bookmarklet so you just create a new "bookmark" in your web browser and paste [this code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0h4crying0utloud/robinhood-bookmarklet-total-percentage-change-col/master/rh-bookmarklet.js) in the URL field. Then when you're on the account's stock table page, just hit this bookmark button and the column should be added. 

# Known issues
Ideally RH adds features to replace this script because this is essentially a dirty hack that is quite brittle. 
- Breaks the linking and sorting abilities on the other columns (Just refesh to  get them back)
